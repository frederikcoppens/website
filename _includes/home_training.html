    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>The Freiburg Galaxy Team cares about training.</p>

	<p>Twice a year, we organize a week-long workshop on NGS data analysis, here
	in Freiburg. We also regularly lead training events around the world,
	covering a wider range of topics such as data analysis, development, and
	Galaxy administration. You can check our <a href="{{site.url}}/{{base.url}}/events">calendar</a>
	to find out how to join our next workshop.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot meet the demand for training. For those of you unable to attend one of our training sessions, we offer 
    training materials, freely accessible online at <a href="http://training.galaxyproject.org">http://training.galaxyproject.org</a></p>
