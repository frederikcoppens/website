<h3>Registered Users</h3>

User data on UseGalaxy.be (i.e. datasets, histories) will be available as long
as they are not deleted by the user. Once marked as deleted the datasets will
be permanently removed within 14 days. If the user "purges" the dataset in the
Galaxy, it will be removed immediately, permanently.

An extended quota can be requested for a limited time period in special cases. Please get in touch at galaxy@elixir-belgium.org

permanently deleted.
