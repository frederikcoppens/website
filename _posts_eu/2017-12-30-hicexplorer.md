Hi-C has become a standard technique for the genome-wide analysis of
chromosome conformation. Analysis of Hi-C data provides insights into folding principles of the
chromatin, functional compartments within the nucleus, as well as long range enhancer-promoter
interactions. Integration of Hi-C and other epigenomic datasets has
helped researchers in understanding of mechanisms of gene regulation and genetic diseases. 

Today we released HiCExplorer 2.0 to provide an easy and user-friendly access to
the analysis of Hi-C data. Starting with the mapping of the raw sequence data,
creation of the contact matrices, the correction of contact matrices, to the computation of
topological associated domains (TADs) and A/B compartments. A detailed quality report generated
during the process, which, using the support of MultiQC, allows users to compare multiple Hi-C
datasets. Finally, the users can create publication ready plots of the contact matrix,
A/B compartments, and TADs on a selected genomic locus, along with additional information
like gene tracks or ChIP-Seq signals. 

A template workflow is shared with everyone and an example history is also available.

For more detailed information check out the [HiCExplorer GitHub repository](https://github.com/deeptools/HiCExplorer),
our [Galaxy Docker flavor](https://github.com/deeptools/docker-galaxy-hicexplorer) or two publication were it
was used already:

Of course all tools are available
from the [Galaxy ToolShed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening/suite_hicexplorer) and installable into any
Galaxy instance.
