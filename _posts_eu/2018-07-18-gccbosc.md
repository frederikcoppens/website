The event started with 2 days of training. Bérénice, Joachim, and Björn trained there ([Galaxy 101 - A gentle introduction to using Galaxy](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/DmxD/galaxy-101-a-gentle-introduction-to-using-galaxy), [Bioinformatics Training and Education with the Galaxy Training Network](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/Drp9/bioinformatics-training-and-education-with-the-galaxy-training-network), [Conda and Containers](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/Dn3G/conda-and-containers), [Galaxy Interactive Environments](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/DnAc/galaxy-interactive-environments)) but also participated on trainings.

Then, the two day conference started with several interesting keynotes ([Tracy K Teal on Democratization of data](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EQF7/opening-keynote-tracy-k-teal-democratizing-data), [Fernando Pérez on Jupyter](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EQ3d/keynote-fernando-perez-sustainable-development-of-scientific-open-source-tools-a-view-from-jupyter) or [Lucia Peixoto on reproducibility of biology](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EQFC/closing-keynote-confound-it-reproducible-biology-from-omics-data-analysis)) and parallel tracks of talks and posters for GCC and BOSC. Joachim presented [Galaxy HiCExplorer](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EYNG/galaxy-hicexplorer-hicexplorer-deeptools3-and-pygenometracks) and Bérénice a [report of the Galaxy Training material](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/event/EYF1/a-fruitful-year-for-the-galaxy-training-materials).

After these 4 days the CollaborationFest started - and it was really productive! Many discussions, new contributions and contributors, improvement of our training materials, new Bioconda packages and new BioContainer and so much more that will find its way into the next Galaxy releases.

This conference was really intense in so many ways! To get the feeling, you can check out Twitter: [#GCCBOSC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gccbosc?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash")
