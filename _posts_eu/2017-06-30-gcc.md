- On 26th and 27th June, they participated to the [hackathons](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/10). Clemens worked with the GalaxyP community, particularly on training. Bérénice worked on the web-browser extension to build Galaxy interactive tours (in collaboration with [TailorDev](https://tailordev.fr/)), leading to the first version of [galaxy-tourbuilder](https://github.com/TailorDev/galaxy-tourbuilder). Björn taught many people on Galaxy, tools, visualizations, etc. 

- On 28th, Björn gave training about ["Advanced customisation of a Galaxy instance"](https://gcc2017.sched.com/event/9muI/advanced-customisation-of-a-galaxy-instance), together with E. Rasche and Martin Čech. In the same time, Clemens was involved in ["Galaxy for Proteomics" training](https://gcc2017.sched.com/event/9n0M/galaxy-for-proteomics) with the GalaxyP community and Bérénice with Saskia Hiltemann on ["How to analyze metagenomic and amplicon data in Galaxy"](https://gcc2017.sched.com/event/9n0O/how-to-analyze-metagenomic-and-amplicon-data-in-galaxy). At the end of the day, Björn and Bérénice taught ["Galaxy for Training and Education"](https://gcc2017.sched.com/event/9n1K/galaxy-for-training-and-education)
