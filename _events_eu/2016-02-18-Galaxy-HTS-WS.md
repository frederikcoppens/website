We are offering another Galaxy workshop on HTS data analysis in  February 2016!

The Bioinformatics and Deep-Sequencing Unit at the MPI-IE Freiburg and the Bioinformatics group at the Department of Computer Science, ALU, offer an introductory course to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data using the Galaxy platform.

Final content of the workshop will be selected in accordance with the participants. Topics could be data analysis of RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Exome-seq, MethylC-seq, Proteomics and Cheminformatics.
