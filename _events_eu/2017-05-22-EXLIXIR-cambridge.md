---

The aim of the [ELIXIR/GOBLET/GTN hackathon](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-goblet-gtn-hackathon-for-galaxy-training-material-re-use-0ee16689-cd8e-4c02-af86-714e1e1e062b) for Galaxy training material re-use is to extend and improve the content of the Galaxy Training material repository

Learning goals:
- Build on an existing collection of Galaxy training materials
- Improve materials’ annotations
- Align them with existing ELIXIR efforts
- Extend the existing “curated” dataset collection
- Increase the number of Docker/Virtual Machines available for easy installation of Galaxy training environments
- Explore the feasibility of developing a toolkit to facilitate plug in of different datasets in existing training material/workflows through a templating approach
